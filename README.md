# Top-Gun-Collision-Experts
Top Gun Collision Experts is a small auto-repair shop managed by my very close friend. While business has been growing rapidly, the business is still heavily reliant on paper, making it increasingly difficult to manage with scale. Thus, I built this ServiceNow application as a Proof-of-Concept to show how digital transformation can increase management efficiency by storing customer info and tracking repair statuses all on one platform. 

Please switch to sn_instances/dev105230 to see the application source code.
