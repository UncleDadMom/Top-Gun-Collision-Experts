# Top-Gun-Collision-Experts
Top Gun Collision Experts is a small auto-repair shop managed by my very close friend. While business has been growing rapidly, the business is still heavily reliant on paper and Excel, making it increasingly difficult for one person to manage. Thus, I built this ServiceNow application as a Proof-of-Concept to show how much more efficiently a business can be managed by storing customer info and tracking repair statuses all on one digital platform.
